        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at Full stack Toronto Inc. events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout events. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
          <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
          <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
          <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
          <p>Sponsors and Speakers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular they should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
          <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
          <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a staff member immediately. Staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of events. We value your attendance.</p>
          <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all Full Stack Toronto Inc. related events and social events.</p>
