# TechMasters Goes to Summer Camp!

The [Fireside Conference](http://www.firesideconf.com) team has provided a great opportunity for the #TechMasters community to join in on the festivities at #firesideconf this year.

For those who are unaware, [#firesideconf](http://www.firesideconf.com) is an annual off the grid and all-inclusive retreat for startups, founders, entrepreneurs, investors and thought leaders. It takes place this September 9, 10 & 11 in the middle of nowhere between Toronto and Ottawa on a beautiful 750+ acre green-space on a pristine private lake. They host speaker sessions around campfires while roasting marshmallows and discussing ideas that change the world. It’s a transformational experience for all attendees and there’s truly nothing like it that we (or they) know of.

The mandate of Fireside Conference is to have an intimate weekend with 200+ of the key stakeholders in our tech & startup community to discuss important topics, learn, relationship build and have fun, all with the objective of strengthening the tech/startup ecosystem in the corridor (Toronto/KW) and surrounding regions. The audience will be a mix of leaders from startups, tech companies and small businesses along with some of the most influential people and key decision makers from the investor and startup community. 

### Fireside Conference is invite only.

The focus is person-to-person relationships. As such, unlike most tech conferences, Fireside Conference looks to set aside technology for the weekend so their delegates can “disconnect to connect.” 
To keep with their summer camp roots, the entire summer camp facility is open to its guests to water ski, canoe/kayak/sail, climb walls and play all kinds of sports. 
Here is a video that I think captures Fireside Conference very well!

The [#firesideconf](http://www.firesideconf.com) team is able to put together some special pricing for us. Tickets are typically $849 but are available to this group for $525 each if we are able to fill a cabin of 12-16 people. Tickets are all inclusive of your conference ticket, food (lots!), open bar (mmm), accommodations, and all camp activities (waterskiing, ropes, sports, etc).
